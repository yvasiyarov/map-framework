## Example B: Cross-Cutting Concern (Complex)

**Goal**: "Add audit logging to all admin actions"

**Why this is tricky**: Touches many files, needs consistent pattern, architectural decision

## Example C: Anti-Pattern Gallery (DO NOT DO THIS)

**Goal**: "Add user authentication"

**BAD Decomposition** (multiple violations):

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "complexity": "medium",
    "estimated_hours": 20,
    "risks": [],
    "dependencies": []
  },
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Add authentication",
      "description": "Make the API secure",
      "dependencies": [],
      "estimated_complexity": "high",
      "complexity_score": 8,
      "complexity_rationale": "High complexity",
      "test_strategy": {
        "unit": "Test it works",
        "integration": "N/A",
        "e2e": "N/A"
      },
      "affected_files": ["backend"],
      "acceptance": ["It works", "Users can login"]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Add tests",
      "description": "Write tests for auth",
      "dependencies": [],
      "estimated_complexity": "low",
      "complexity_score": 2,
      "test_strategy": {
        "unit": "Write tests",
        "integration": "N/A",
        "e2e": "N/A"
      },
      "affected_files": ["tests"],
      "acceptance": ["Tests pass"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What's Wrong** (annotated):

| Issue | Violation | How to Fix |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `"title": "Add authentication"` | ❌ NOT ATOMIC - encompasses 5+ subtasks | Split into: User model, Password hashing, Login endpoint, Session management, Auth middleware |
| `"description": "Make the API secure"` | ❌ VAGUE - no implementation guidance | Specify: "Create User model with email, hashed_password fields using bcrypt" |
| `"dependencies": []` for both | ❌ MISSING DEPS - tests depend on implementation | Subtask 2 should have `"dependencies": ["ST-001"]` |
| `"risks": []` for medium complexity | ❌ EMPTY RISKS - auth always has risks | Add: "Password hashing algorithm choice", "Session hijacking", "Token expiration handling" |
| `"complexity_rationale": "High complexity"` | ❌ NO CALCULATION - just restates category | Use framework: "Score X: factor (+N), factor (+N)..." |
| `"affected_files": ["backend"]"` | ❌ VAGUE PATHS - not actionable | Use: "models/user.py", "services/auth_service.py", "api/routes/auth.py" |
| `"acceptance": ["It works"]"` | ❌ NOT TESTABLE - subjective | Use: "POST /login returns JWT token with valid credentials" |

**CORRECT Decomposition** would have 5-7 subtasks:
1. Create User model with authentication fields
2. Implement password hashing service
3. Create login/logout endpoints
4. Implement JWT token generation
5. Add authentication middleware
6. Write integration tests for auth flow
7. Document authentication API

## Example D: Ambiguous Goal Handling

**Goal**: "Improve performance"

**Problem**: Goal is too vague - multiple valid interpretations

**How to Handle**:

1. **Use sequentialthinking** to explore interpretations
2. **Return empty subtasks with open_questions**
3. **Request clarification before decomposing**

**Decomposition Response**:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "analysis": {
    "assumptions": [],
    "open_questions": [
      "Which system component is experiencing performance issues?",
      "What metrics indicate the current performance problem?",
      "What is the target performance improvement (latency, throughput, resource usage)?",
      "Is this about backend, frontend, database, or all of the above?"
    ]
  },
  "blueprint": {
    "id": "pending-clarification",
    "summary": "Decomposition blocked pending requirement clarification",
    "subtasks": []
  }
}
```

**Note**: For ambiguous goals, it's BETTER to return empty subtasks with clear questions than to guess wrong.

**After Clarification** ("Database queries are slow - reduce average query time from 500ms to 50ms"):

The decomposition would then include specific subtasks:
1. Profile and identify slowest queries
2. Add missing database indexes
3. Optimize N+1 query patterns
4. Implement query result caching
5. Add query performance monitoring
